Reborn version of the Zylon Mod. Give me a few updates, and this mod will be completely remade from craziness to something actually good.

This mod has many peculiar things, including ore furniture, two unique subclasses, and a giant floating ball of dirt.
This mod also has QoL changes, such as an easier Slime Crown recipe, crimson alternates, tons of vanilla recipes, and some hardmode enemies dropping prehardmode loot.
Some changes can be only accessed via the config, like the Pearlwood buff.

Update V0.2.5.7: Carnallite Update
~Added Stardust Fragment Staff (the oldest brother of the floating object summon weapons, for now).
~Heavily nerfed ore staves (what was I thinking!?).
~Completely reworked Carnallite Bars: Green bars are mineable after EoC is defeated, and Red bars are crafted with Green bars and Empress Shards.
~Made Empress Slime drop more Empress Shards due to above change.

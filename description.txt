This mod has unique content, including ore furniture and three new subclasses.
This mod also has QoL changes, such as an easier Slime Crown recipe, crimson alternates, tons of vanilla recipes, and some hardmode enemies dropping prehardmode loot.
Some changes can be only accessed via the config, like the Pearlwood buff.
PLEASE READ: Some parts of the mod are very bad, I am trying my hardest to fix them as soon as possible, please be patient...

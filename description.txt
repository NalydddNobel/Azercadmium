Reborn version of the Zylon Mod. Give me a few updates, and this mod will be completely remade from craziness to something actually good.

This mod has many peculiar things, including ore furniture, two unique subclasses, and a giant floating ball of dirt.
This mod also has QoL changes, such as an easier Slime Crown recipe, crimson alternates, tons of vanilla recipes, and some hardmode enemies dropping prehardmode loot.
Some changes can be only accessed via the config, like the Pearlwood buff.

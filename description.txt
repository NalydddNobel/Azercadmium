Reborn version of the Zylon Mod. Give me a few updates, and this mod will be completely remade from craziness to something actually good.

This mod has many interesting things, including ore furniture, crimson alternates, and a giant floating ball of dirt.
This mod also has QoL changes, such as an easier Slime Crown recipe and some hardmode enemies drop prehardmode loot.

If you are worried about a custom biome ruining your world, don't worry, it has been removed.
School has started for me and I can't work on the mod all day anymore, sorry.
